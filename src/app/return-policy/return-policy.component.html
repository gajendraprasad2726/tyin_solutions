  <h5>Return & Cancellation Policy</h5>

  <p>We are a technology platform that connects buyers with sellers. We do not manufacture, store, or directly sell any products listed on the platform. All products are sold by independent sellers who are responsible for their own policies regarding returns, refunds, and cancellations.</p>

  <h6>1. Returns & Refunds</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Return and refund eligibility is determined solely by the respective seller.</li>
    <li>Each product listing will specify whether it is eligible for return, the time frame, and any applicable charges.</li>
    <li>Buyers must contact the seller directly to initiate a return or refund request.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The platform is not responsible for resolving disputes related to returns or refunds. However, we provide a mechanism for buyers to raise complaints if a seller fails to respond.</p>

  <h6>2. Order Cancellations</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Orders can only be cancelled before they are shipped. This must be done directly through the seller.</li>
    <li>If an order has already been shipped, cancellation may not be possible, and the return process (if applicable) must be followed instead.</li>
    <li>Sellers reserve the right to cancel orders due to out-of-stock items, pricing errors, or other unforeseen circumstances.</li>
  </ul>

  <h6>3. Dispute Resolution</h6>
  <p>If you face an issue with a seller regarding return or refund, you may file a complaint through our platform's grievance redressal system. While we aim to support our users, we are not liable for the actions of independent sellers.</p>

  <h6>4. Non-Returnable Products</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Personal hygiene items, perishable goods, customized/personalized products, and other such items may not be eligible for return unless damaged or defective on arrival.</li>
  </ul>

  <h6>5. Grievance Contact</h6>
  <p>For unresolved complaints or assistance, please contact our Grievance Officer:</p>
